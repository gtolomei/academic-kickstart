I am happy to announce that the **H**uman-**E**xplainable and **RO**bust **M**achine **L**earning (**HERO-ML**) Lab was officially launched today, August 26, 2021.

The research mission of HERO-ML Lab is to make next-generation ML and AI systems more **understandable** to humans   
as well as **resilient** to adversarial attacks.

Are you interested to join the team? Feel free to drop me a message at <a href="mailto:tolomei@di.uniroma1.it">tolomei@di.uniroma1.it</a> or visit the website (TBA soon!) for more information about past and ongoing research projects, as well as opportunities with the lab.  
In the meantime, follow the official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/hero_ml_lab">@hero_ml_lab</a> to keep you up to date!
