I am very happy to announce that the <b>H</b>uman-<b>E</b>xplainable and <b>RO</b>bust Machine Learning (<b>HERO-ML</b>) Research Group was officially launched today, August 26, 2021.

The research mission of HERO-ML is to make next-generation ML and AI systems more **understandable** to humans as well as **resilient** to possible adversarial attacks.
