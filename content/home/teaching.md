  This is a first-year course of the MSc in Data Science; indeed, it is one of the three modules which the course "_Fundamentals of Information Systems_" is made of.
  The goal of this module is to teach the basics of the Python programming language along with a special focus on Data Science. In particular, students will become familiar with Python packages that are widely used by the community of data scientists, such as ```numpy```, ```scipy```, ```pandas```, ```seaborn```, and ```scikit-learn```, just to name a few.
  A full detailed description of the course is available [here](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2018/LM/SC/SC2377/000ZZ/SCP7078720/N0).
