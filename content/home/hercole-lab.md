I am happy to announce that the **H**uman-**E**xplainable, **R**obust, and **CO**llaborative **LE**arning (**HERCOLE**) Lab was officially launched today, August 26, 2021.

The research mission of the HERCOLE Lab is to make next-generation ML and AI systems more **understandable** to humans, **resilient** to adversarial attacks, and **decentralized** to edge devices.

Are you interested to join the team?
