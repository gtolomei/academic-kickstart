<center><b>HERO-ML Lab is Open!</b></center>

I am happy to announce that the **H**uman-**E**xplainable and **RO**bust Machine Learning (**HERO-ML**) Lab was officially launched as of August 26, 2021.

The research mission of HERO-ML Lab is to make next-generation ML and AI systems more **understandable** to humans
as well as **resilient** to adversarial attacks.

Are you interested to join the team?
Feel free to drop me a message at <a href="mailto:tolomei@di.uniroma1.it">tolomei@di.uniroma1.it</a> or visit https://www.hero-ml.it (currently under construction!) for more information about past and ongoing research projects, and Bachelor/Master/Ph.D. thesis opportunities with the lab.
In the meantime, stay tuned and follow the official Twitter account [@hero_ml_lab](https://twitter.com/hero_ml_lab) to keep you always up to date!
