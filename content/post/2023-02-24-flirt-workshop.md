<center><b>FLIRT@SIGIR 2023</b></center>

I am happy to announce that the **1st Workshop on Federated Learning for Information Retrieval** (**FLIRT**) will be hosted at the <a href="https://sigir.org/sigir2023/" target="_blank">46th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval</a>.

The goal of FLIRT is to provide an open forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas, identify key challenges, and define the roadmap toward a successful application of federated learning in the broad information retrieval domain.

Sounds cool?<br/>
